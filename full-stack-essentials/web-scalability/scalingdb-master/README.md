# This wasn't all me

This whole folder came from https://github.com/nguyenhmp/scalingdb. He provided the basis for what this project becomes. I was gonna clone it but i didn't want to deal with potential version control issues since I'm putting all my homework on github. Basically I didn't want to risk having an embedded repository on my hands because that terrifies me.
